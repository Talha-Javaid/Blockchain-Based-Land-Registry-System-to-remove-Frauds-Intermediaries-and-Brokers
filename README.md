# Blockchain-Based-Land-Registry-System-to-remove-Frauds-Intermediaries-and-Brokers

The commercial Land Registration market is a significant part of the global economy, currently dominated by a small set of firms and organizations that lack transparency. The process of land transfers also requires third party intervention which is expensive.

In many countries, the process of ownership transfers is problematic. We are still  in the initial steps of digitization, due to the improvement required in terms of use of technology to represent assets in digital forms. Increase in liquidity of investments and purchases, proper management, documentation as well as ease of access is the future of Land Management and real estate. Blockchain technologies have the potential to drive these changes.

# Current Land Registry System in Pakistan

In Pakistan and other parts of the world land registration process and maintenance is too tedious since it involves safekeeping of large volumes of registers in written form. The main issue with the above-mentioned method of land registry maintenance is that any future reference that needs o be taken from these hard copies will involve too much labour. This process is time consuming.

Also the current system is not secured since majority of the process is not transparent, system is slow, and selling a property more than once needs to be recorded accurately. Several approaches have been made to automate the land registry data maintenance by eliminating the process of keeping bookish records. This is initially done by storing the data in huge databases. But such a method is not efficient in terms of data security as the data contents are breached easily as data tampering can happen in case of poorly maintained databases.

# How Blockchain can help?

Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that keeps historical record of all transactions that have taken place across a peer-to-peer network. Implementing land registry using blockchain helps in avoiding fraudulent activities thereby making the system more secure. Since it is difficult to duplicate the blockchain.

Implementing land registry using this technology helps in avoiding any illegal activities involved in land transactions. Contracts and ownership details are maintained in a decentralized method. It is easier to track the data transaction from the block chain implementation as it eliminates the need for physical intervention and thus improves the overall security for users of the system. Blockchain provides an opportunity to establish a strong system for digital identity.

Using blockchain, each block in the network represents the data involved in a land transaction which includes details like property id, property number, owner details, transaction amount, mode of payment and last transaction details such as amount that has been paid for that transaction. By the proper use of blockchain technology we can ensure data protection as well as systematic arrangement of data collected.
