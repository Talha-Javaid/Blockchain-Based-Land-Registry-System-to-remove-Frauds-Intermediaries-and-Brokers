# Blockchain-Based-Land-Registry-System-to-remove-Frauds-Intermediaries-and-Brokers

The land registry system is one of the very important department in any governance system that stores the records of land ownership. There are various issues and loopholes in the existing system that give rise to corruption and disputes. This requires a significant chunk of valuable government resources from judiciary and law enforcement agencies in settling these issues.

Blockchain technology has the potential to counter these loopholes and sort out the issues related with land registry system like tempering of records, trading of the same piece of land to more than one buyer. In this project a secure and reliable framework for land registry system using Blockchain has been implemented.

The framework uses the concept of smart contract at various stages of the land registry and gives an algorithm for pre-agreement. First, the conventional land registry system in Pakistan and the issues are highlighted. Then, I jave outlined the potential benefits of employing Blockchain technology in the land registry system and presented a framework.

# Current Land Registry System in Pakistan

In Pakistan and other parts of the world land registration process and maintenance is too tedious since it involves safekeeping of large volumes of registers in written form. The main issue with the above-mentioned method of land registry maintenance is that any future reference that needs o be taken from these hard copies will involve too much labour. This process is time consuming.

Also the current system is not secured since majority of the process is not transparent, system is slow, and selling a property more than once needs to be recorded accurately. Several approaches have been made to automate the land registry data maintenance by eliminating the process of keeping bookish records. This is initially done by storing the data in huge databases. But such a method is not efficient in terms of data security as the data contents are breached easily as data tampering can happen in case of poorly maintained databases.

# Challenges in the existing land registry process

> The Involvement of middlemen and brokers

> The increasing number of fraud cases
 
> Time Delays

> Human error/intervention

# How Blockchain can help?

Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that keeps historical record of all transactions that have taken place across a peer-to-peer network. Implementing land registry using blockchain helps in avoiding fraudulent activities thereby making the system more secure. Since it is difficult to duplicate the blockchain.

Implementing land registry using this technology helps in avoiding any illegal activities involved in land transactions. Contracts and ownership details are maintained in a decentralized method. It is easier to track the data transaction from the block chain implementation as it eliminates the need for physical intervention and thus improves the overall security for users of the system. Blockchain provides an opportunity to establish a strong system for digital identity.

Using blockchain, each block in the network represents the data involved in a land transaction which includes details like property id, property number, owner details, transaction amount, mode of payment and last transaction details such as amount that has been paid for that transaction. By the proper use of blockchain technology we can ensure data protection as well as systematic arrangement of data collected.
